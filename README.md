 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project predicts the selling prices of houses based on various features using a Linear Regression model. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and run on Google Collab using Python.
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a simple yet effective machine learning model that can predict house prices from input features. The dataset is analyzed, cleaned, and used to train a regression model, which is then evaluated on test data.

Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: Linear Regression
- Steps Followed:
  1. Load and understand the dataset
  2. Clean and preprocess the data
  3. Split the data into training and testing sets
  4. Fit a Linear Regression model
  5. Evaluate the model using R² score
 Model Performance
- R² Score: Achieved a good score on the test data indicating the model is able to explain a significant portion of variance in the house prices.
